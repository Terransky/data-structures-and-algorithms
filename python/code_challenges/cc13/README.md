# Stack Queue Brackets
Look through a queue or stack presumably to determine whether brackets are balanced.

## Challenge
Given a bracket input, traverse through a linked list and find its matching but opposed bracket.

## Whiteboard Process

No idea how to write for the tests

## Approach & Efficiency

### Approach
No idea

### Time and Space Complexity
Time is O(1) because regardless of input, time for traversal is either the top/front or bottom/rear
Space is O(1) generally but may be O(n) when we push or enqueue since we are increasing memory demand
based on variable user input.
