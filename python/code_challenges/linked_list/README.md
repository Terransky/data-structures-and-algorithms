# Singly Linked List

Create linked list that only traverses forward.

## Challenge

Must be able to add new node to head, search for a value, and return a string representing all
values in the linked list.

## Approach & Efficiency

I took the classic approach. Big O for time is n and space is 1.
The time is takes will depend on the number of nodes.
The space it consumes will always be static, unless added to by method.
